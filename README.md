# ðŸŽ¥ Mediasoup SFU with HLS  

A minimal full-stack application demonstrating real-time video streaming between 
users via WebRTC (using **mediasoup SFU**), and live HLS playback for spectators via 
**FFmpeg**. Built with **NestJS** and **Next.js**.

---


### User Journey:

- **User 1 & 2** open `/stream`: they can enable camera/mic and are connected via WebRTC (through Mediasoup).
- **User 3** opens `/watch`: can view the interaction between User 1 and 2 as a real-time **HLS** stream.
